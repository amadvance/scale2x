.SH DESCRIPTION 
Scale2x, Scale3x and Scale4x are real\-time graphics effects
able to increase the size of small bitmaps guessing the
missing pixels without blurring the images.
.PP
They were originally developed for the AdvanceMAME project
in the year 2001 to improve the quality of old games running
at low video resolutions.

.IP \(bu
Only the pixel sizes of 1, 2 and 4 bytes are supported. If the
image has another pixel size it\'s automatically converted.
