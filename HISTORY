Scale2x HISTORY
===============

4.1 2018/04
===========
 * Added a new ARM NEON implementation [Thomas Bernard].
   To enable it, you must build with the -mfpu=neon option.
 * Support implementation selection at runtime with the new -o cmdline
   option, and the "opt" function argument.

4.0 2016/11
===========
 * Added a new SSE2 implementation using intrinsics that replaces the old
   MMX one [Thomas Bernard].
   To enable it, you must build with the -msse2 option.
 * Made source ANSI C compliant [Thomas Bernard].
 * Windows binaries built with gcc 4.9.3 using the MXE cross compiler at
   commit 62bcdbee56e87c81f1faa105b8777a5879d4e2e with targets
   i686-w64-mingw32 and x86_64-w64-mingw32.

3.2 2015/08
===========
 * Revised the license. Now it's only GPLv2+.
 * Windows binary built with gcc 4.8.1 using the MXE cross compiler 2.23,
   with targets i686-w64-mingw32. Before the target was i686-pc-mingw32.

3.1 2014/03
===========
 * Updated to the new documentation/autoconf/git standard.

3.0 2013/05
===========
 * Now in git repository.
 * Preliminary scale2k support in the 'scalerx' tool. Just select the algo
   revision 'k'. It's the new effect used by AdvanceMAME.
 * Removed libpng.dll and zlib.dll files. They are not needed anymore.

2.5 2011/9
==========
 * Fixed compilation with newer libpng.
 * New EPX and "Depixelizing Pixel Art" documents in contrib/

2.4 2009/7
==========
 * Added MMX support for x86_64 [Per Øyvind Karlsen]

2.3 2005/11
===========
 * Some additions in the contrib/ directory.

2.2 2005/03
===========
 * Fixed a typo in the algorithm documentation of scale3x.
   Specifically the definition of the E3 point in
   the algorithm.txt file was wrong.

2.1 2004/12
===========
 * Added the `scale2x3' and `scale2x4' effects.
 * Fixed the computation of the border pixels for scale3x.
 * Fixed the scalebit.c implementation to be C++
   compatible [Max Horn]

2.0 2004/02
===========
 * Added a new revision of the `scale3x' effect. It now looks good as
   `scale2x'.
 * Added a new optimized C version of the `scale2x' effect.
 * Added a detailed algorithm specification in the `algorithm.txt' file.
 * Minor fixes at the scalebit.c file.

1.6 2003/07
===========
 * Added an example of the fast implementation of the effects
   applied to a generic bitmap. There is also an
   example for the not obvious Scale4x effect.
 * Revised the command line tools. Now they support all the
   formats of .PNG images. Also images with 16 bits per
   channel.
 * Fixed a linking problem with some libpng installations.

1.5 2003/05
===========
 * Added the scale3x and scale4x command line tools.

1.4 2003/01
===========
 * Added in the contrib dir a VisualC MMX assembler implementation
   by VisualBoy from the VisualBoyAdvance emulator.

1.3 2002/12
===========
 * Added the contrib dir with some example implementations.
   Java by Randy Power and C SDL by Pete Shinners.

1.2 2002/11
===========
 * The new Scale2x site is now http://scale2x.sourceforge.net
 * The MMX implementation now correctly computes the pixel on the
   left and right border.
 * Renamed the -t option in -w.

1.1 2002/11
===========
 * Added the -t option at the command line converter.

1.0 2002/11
===========
 * First version of the library
